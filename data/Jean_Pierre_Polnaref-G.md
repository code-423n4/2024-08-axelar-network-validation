## Unoptimized Loop in Signer Rotation

### 1. Summary
The `_setup` function contains a loop that iterates through an array of signers to perform a rotation. This loop can be optimized to reduce gas consumption, especially when dealing with a large number of signers. The current implementation performs overflow checks for the loop counter on each iteration, which can be avoided for efficiency.

### 2. Severity
Low

### 3. Impact
Although the impact is not critical, optimizing the loop can offer the following benefits:

- **Gas Efficiency**: By avoiding unnecessary overflow checks, gas consumption is reduced, which is beneficial when processing large arrays.
- **Performance Improvement**: The execution becomes more efficient, especially when handling a large number of signers, leading to potentially lower transaction costs.

### 4. Recommendation
To optimize the loop, you can use Solidity's `unchecked` block to avoid overflow checks when incrementing the loop counter. This is effective because the bounds of the loop are already controlled by the length of the array, making overflow checks redundant in this context.

### 5. Improved Code Example

```solidity
function _setup(bytes calldata data) internal override {
    (address operator_, WeightedSigners[] memory signers) = abi.decode(data, (address, WeightedSigners[]));

    if (operator_ != address(0)) {
        _transferOperatorship(operator_);
    }

    uint256 signersLength = signers.length;
    for (uint256 i; i < signersLength; ) {
        _rotateSigners(signers[i], false);
        unchecked { ++i; } // Using unchecked block to save gas on overflow checks
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`unchecked { ++i; }`**: This construct is used to increment the loop counter without performing overflow checks, which saves gas.

### 6. Conclusion
Optimizing the loop in the `_setup` function by eliminating unnecessary overflow checks improves gas efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving a large number of signers. While the impact is minimal, this optimization contributes to the overall performance and efficiency of the contract.
