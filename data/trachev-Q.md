### [L-01] Wrong data decoding in `_checkPayloadAgainstGatewayData`

The `_checkPayloadAgainstGatewayData` decodes `payload` the following way:
```solidity
(, bytes32 tokenId, , , uint256 amountInPayload) = abi.decode(payload, (uint256, bytes32, uint256, uint256, uint256));
```

The issue is that this is incorrect as the correct approach would be:
```solidity
(, bytes32 tokenId, , , uint256 amountInPayload) = abi.decode(payload, (uint256, bytes32, bytes, bytes, uint256, bytes));
```

Currently, this is not an issue as the values decoded wrongly are not used, but may pose a problem in future upgrades.

### [L-02] `InterchainTokenIdClaimed` is not emitted in `deployInterchainToken`

The `InterchainTokenIdClaimed` event is emitted in `deployTokenManager`, however the emition is omitted in `deployInterchainToken`, which has the same functionality as `deployTokenManager`, except that it also deploys an interchain token. Thus, the `InterchainTokenIdClaimed` should be emitted in both functions.

### [L-03] `expressExecute` can be invoked by malicious express executors

Currently `expressExecute` can be invoked by any address, without providing actual data, connected to a valid interchain transfer. As a result, a malicious caller can set the amount variable to 0 or 1 wei, in order to invoke `expressExecuteWithInterchainToken` on any `destinationAddress` through ITS, without actually transferring any funds. This is not dangerous for the protocol, but may be harmful for the `destinationAddress` if their `expressExecuteWithInterchainToken` implementation is not sufficiently validated. Also the `InterchainTransferReceived` can be freely emitted with invalid data.

To avoid any risks, the protocol team must be aware that `InterchainTransferReceived` may return harmful data, and users of the protocol must be informed that `expressExecuteWithInterchainToken` must be thoroughly validated.

### [L-04] Funds may be stuck in ITS

`interchainTransfer` and `callContractWithInterchainToken` send `gasValue`, provided by the caller, to `gasService`. The issue is that `msg.value` may be more than `gasValue`. The excess ETH would stay in ITS and will likely be used by other users to fund their transfers.
Consider, refunding any excess ETH back to the caller.
